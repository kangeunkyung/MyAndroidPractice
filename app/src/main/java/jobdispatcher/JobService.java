/**
 * JobService is the fundamental unit of work used in the JobDispatcher.
 *
 * <p>Users will need to override {@link #onStartJob(JobParameters)}, which is where any
 * asynchronous execution should start. This method, like most lifecycle methods, runs on the main
 * thread; you <b>must</b> offload execution to another thread (or {@link android.os.AsyncTask}, or
 * {@link android.os.Handler}, or your favorite flavor of concurrency).
 *
 * <p>Once any asynchronous work is complete {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)} should be
 * called to inform the backing driver of the result.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should also override {@link #onStopJob(JobParameters)}, which will be called
 * if the scheduling engine wishes to interrupt your work (most likely because the runtime
 * constraints that are associated with the job in question are no longer met).
